Simple subtitle synchronizer coded in php. It must be ran in a line command console. It supports two kind of subtitles:

1) .sub -> type 1: 00:00:22,465 --> 00:00:26,866

2) .srt -> type 2: {2236}{2343}que se autodenomina 'Zero Cool'

It uses Object-oriented from php 5.
I've been planing to build an user friendly interface.
